  <h2><p><b>Benefits of Smart Hotels:</b></p></h2>
  <ul>
    <h3><li><b><u>Greater Personalisation: </u></b>One of the main benefits of a smart hotel room is the ability
    to offer guests a greater level of personalisation. This means that a hotel guest can quickly and easily make
  adjustments to their room, in order to get it the precise way they want it, improving their enjoyment of the room and making it feel more like home.</li></h3>
    <h3><li><b><u>Improved Sustainability: </u> </b>For hotel management, one of the biggest advantages of creating
    a smart hotel is the reduced costs that are often associated with the concept. This is primarily due to improvements
  to sustainability and energy efficiency within the hotel rooms, with certain devices only being used when they are actually needed.</li></h3>
    <h3><li><b><u>Enhanced Customer Experience: </u></b>Perhaps the most immediately obvious benefit of a smart hotel room
    is the improvement it can deliver in terms of the customer experience. A smart speaker, such as that provided
  through the Alexa for Hospitality service, assists with this by making it possible for TVs, lights, heating and
other devices to be controlled through voice commands.</li></h3>
    </ul>
