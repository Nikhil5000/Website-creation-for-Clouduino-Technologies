  <h4><p>The Internet of Things is a promising technology that offers enhanced efficiency
  and better quality to the manufacturing industry. So, our manufacturing plants and
production lines are about to undergo some dramatic changes that will make them well-ordered.
We help manufacturers harness shop-floor smart sensors to track assets across factories,
optimize inventory management and make autonomous decisions regarding execution of
manufacturing operations.</p>

  <h2><p><b>Benefits of Smart Manufacturing:</b></p></h2>
  <ul>
    <h3><li><b><u>Asset efficiency:</u> </b>Advancements in sensor technology have enabled manufacturing industry to generate
    huge volumes of data that can be continuously analyzed to reveal asset performance issues, which need corrective optimization.
  An increase in asset efficiency translates to lower downtime, optimized capacity, and reduced changeover time.</li></h3>
    <h3><li><b><u>Quality improvements: </u></b>As discussed, smart factories are capable of implementing a corrective course of action on their own.
    Such principles can also be used to predict and detect quality defect trends sooner along with their
  cause. It will inevitably lower scrap rates and lead times; thereby, increasing fill rates and yield. As a
result, optimized quality process will ensure quality improvements.</li></h3>
    <h3><li><b><u>Maximum flexibility: </u></b>Smart factory logistics systems are equipped to handle a host of different manufacturing environments
    and production setups. As a result, it can handle the differing nature of operational tasks, ensuring
  maximum flexibility. Additionally, advanced sensors technology can automatically recognize
manufacturing demand fluctuations, which, in turn, allows a companyâ€™s supply chain to respond with better agility.</li></h3>
    </ul>
