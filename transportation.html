  <h2><p><b>The benefits of smart technology and the advantages they bring to transportation within a smart city are numerous.</b></p><h2>
  <ul>
    <h3><li><b>Smart Transportation is safer:</b> By combining machine learning with IoT and 5G,
      autonomous transportation systems (both in vehicles and in stationary infrastructure such as intersections)
      have proven to reduce the “human factor” in accidents. Computers don’t get distracted or fatigued or emotional.</li>
      <li><b>Smart Transportation is better managed:</b>Data collection is an important key to responsible public management of
        infrastructure. Smart transportation not only provides detailed data points for every aspect of the transportation
        system, but allows administrators to better monitor operations, track maintenance needs, and identify key sources
        of problems that need to be fixed.</li>
      <li><b>Smart Transportation is more efficient:</b>With better management comes more efficient use. Quality data can help
        to pinpoint areas where efficiency can be improved. Maybe a slight adjustment in train schedules would provide for
        better fill rates, Or, perhaps bus routes would better serve the community if stops were allocated differently.</li>
